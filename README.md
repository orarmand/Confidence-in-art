# Confidence-in-art

Project short abstract: 
In domains where knowledge is limited such as art market or foreign languages, confidence was observed to correlate with response consensuality rather than accuracy. Self Consistency Theory of metacognition suggests that this is observation can be explained by a shared heuristic decision rule across lay people. Beyond this descriptive model of confidence, we asked whether at the subjective level, one's evaluation of one's own and other's decisions would also be linked. In other words, in context where one’s grip on accuracy is limited, can different reflective processes such as metacognition and theory of mind function independently or do they share the same limited evidence? How does our monitoring of our own and other’s decision influence each other and what does it mean about both functions?



Data pre-processing:
Participants were excluded for not having completed the entire experiment. Trials with at least one of three response lacking (decision, confidence, believed consensuallity) were removed (53 trials out of 588). For each painting, the objective consensuallity was calculated across the N=49 participants as a ratio between both answer (scale in percentage as for belief popularity and confidence) and respectively attributed to each participant’s response. 

Data file available for dowload: 
the columns contain respectively: 
• subject number
• task type (2AFC, 3AFC, 4AFC, 6AFC)
• order of reflective question as confidence asked first or believed consensuality
• painting number; price of the painting; painting's maximum consensuality across options (vary with task type)
• response category chosen from lower price to highest price
• response time
• confidence on scale 0-10
• beleived consesuality on scale 0-10
• correctness of the response (or distance from correct in more than 2AFC)
• response consensuality as calculated with participants within a same task
• whether the participant chose the consensual respsonse. 
Columns starting with Z are the data z-scored within participants to normalize across them. 

For data analysis, columns were then also normalised across participants to allow fair comparision across parameters in multiple regressions.
